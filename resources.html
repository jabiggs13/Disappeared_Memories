With over 350 pages of notes, maps, and instructions, this large document was crafted and put into action during the Montt's tenure as President of Guatemala.  It outlines the plans for the scorched-earth campaign and policies against the Maya of Quiche, the hardest-hit and most devestated state/department during the genocide.</h5>
            
            <h5>Apart from the specifics of the plan itself are hand-written patrol reports near Maya villages as well as accounts of military personnel  commiting heinous crimes such as killing unarmed men, women, and children, burning down homes, conducting air-raids on refugees trying to escape the violence, the destruction of crops, the slaughtering of animals, and many more.  This is one of the most valuable documents that gives insight into the military's inner-workings and how they carried out these atrocities.  <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB297/Operation_Sofia_lo.pdf"><u>Click here</u></a> to view a pdf version of <i>Operation Sophia</i> and <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB297/index.htm"><u>here</u></a> for general information about the document itself and the resulting consequences once it came into the hands of the National Security Archive.</h5>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h5>Although the Guatemalan Civil War officially ended in 1996, a commission was formed in 1994, called the La Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico (CEH or Historical Clarification Commission in English), in order to uncover and report all of the human rights violations that had occurred since the beginning of the civil war in the 1960s.  The report was designed to objectively state what happened and what was reported to have happened without taking sides or having any sort of agenda.   The CEH was comprised of three primary individuals: one Maya woman, one Guatemalan man, and one non-national male.</h5>
            
            <h5>The CEH was given a two-year mandate to complete its work, starting in 1997 and ending in 1999, when an official report was published.  Originally published in over 12 volumes and equalling to over 4000 pages, the manuscript which was officially titled <i>Guatemala, memoria del silencio</i> (Guatemala: Memory of Silence or <i>Tz'ibil Na'tab'al</i> in a Mayan dialect).  These pages are filled with testimonies of eye-witnesses to the atrocities committed during the war, especially in the early 1980s, off-handed reports that traveled via word-of-mouth, and case examples of specific targeting of individuals.  The findings were presented to the Guatemalan government, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG - started out as the guerilla groups but formally organized and became a part of the political system in 1996 with the ceasefire agreement), and the UN Secretary General.  <a href="http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/descargas/guatemala-memoria-silencio/guatemala-memoria-del-silencio.pdf"><u>Click here</u></a> to view the the original report in Spanish or <a href="https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/mos_en.pdf"><u>here</u></a> for an abbreviated English version.</h5>
