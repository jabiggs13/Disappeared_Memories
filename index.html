      <h3>A Brief History of the Ramp-Up to the Massacres</h3>
      <br>
      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column"><h4>The Guatemalan Genocide, also known as The Silent Holocaust or the Mayan Genocide, was a series of raids, massacres, forced disappearances, and other terror events that occurred during the Guatemalan Civil War which took place between 1960-1996.  The height of the atrocities occurred between 1981 and 1983 and the vast majority of them were against rural Maya groups and villages.  The reasons behind all of these events is complex with many moving parts related to the on-going civil war at the time, the 500 years of colonial and institutional oppression and resulting racism against indigenous groups, the fear of the spread of communism, land rights held by or given to some Maya groups, and many more.  All of these factors coalesced into a sscorched-earth campaign that was carried out in 1982 and 1983.  The Guatemalan Army justified most of the reported killings and forced disappearances of indigenous Maya by stating they had ties to the Guerilla Army of the Poor - the EGP (Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres).</h4>

        <div class="column"><h4>In 1954, the CIA carried out a coup d'état  in Guatemala which got rid of the democratically elected president and put in his place a military dictator, Carlos Castillo Armas.  This was due to both the US's fear of communism spreading to/in the country and due to powerful fruit lobbyist who convinced the government to intervene to preserve the US's claim to agricultural stakes in Guatemala.  (Ernesto Che Guevara was a young man living in Guatemala City at the time of the coup and eventually escaped the country and helped thwart the CIA intervention in Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.)  The EGP formed as a method of resistance against the military dictatoship and against US involvment in foreign governments.  Additionally, the EGP unified under shared oppression against rural farmers and institutional racism against native Maya groups.  Although Maya individuals did participate in this group, the vast majority did not.  However, the Guatemalan Army equated the two (Maya and the EGP) and used this as a justification for killing and abducting Maya people (all ages and both sexes) and for razing villages across the more rural areas of the country - the west and the north.</h4>

        <h4>Below are interactive StoryMaps which allow you to visualize and track a selection of atrocities against the Maya people through time.  The maps are split up temporally, each depicting a separate set of events that represent the general feel of the period.  The maps are split up as follows:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>1970s-1980:  This is thought of as the ramp-up period to the peak of the killings and horros in the early 80s, however there were still numerous massacres during this span.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>1981:  This year was the beginning of the intensification of the killings and attacks on the villages.  Lucas Garc&iacutea was put in place as the military dicator and events against the Maya increased.</h4></li>
          <li><h4>1982-1983:  Lucas Garc&iacutea was replaced as president by Efra&iacuten R&iacuteos Montt, a former general in the army.  Killings, forced disappearances, torture, rape, and village destruction against the Maya exponentially increased, with 1982 being the bloodiest on record.</h4></li>
